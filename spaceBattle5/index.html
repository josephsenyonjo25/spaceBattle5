You are the captain of the USS Schwarzenegger on a mission to destroy all the alien ships with lasers. There are six alien ships. The aliens send one attack ship at a time, and wait to see the outcome of the battle before deploying another alien ship. If the ship survives, it attacks you, if you survive, you attack the ship again- If it survives, it attacks you again, etc.. If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat. If you retreat, the game is over. You win the game if you destroy all the aliens.
